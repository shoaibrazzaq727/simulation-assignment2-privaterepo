# Traffic Light Simulation

This is a simulation of a traffic light at a pedestrian crosswalk, implemented as an extended state machine in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in a terminal.
3. Run the simulation with the command `python traffic_light_simulation.py`.

## Output

The simulation will output the state of the traffic light, the input from the pedestrian, and the output signals every second, as shown in the following example:
